# PITCH_DECK
A lot of Startups find it very difficult to present themselves as a potential opportunity for investment and mobilize funds from investors and banks. Entrepreneurs also do not have an idea about what banks are looking for and end up losing funding opportunities. A technology solution is required that would help educate entrepreneurs on how to prepare financials to propose to a bank for funds and further create a template where startups can put in there data in a format which could be accessed by any investor who wants to fund startups. Hence, there is a need to standardize and automate the process of creating a pitch deck – whereby the user feeds in the inputs asked by the platform, and in the end as an output – there is a standardized business plan that comes up.
